      Romeo and Juliet
    </h1>
    <h2>ACT 1</h2>
    <h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
    <div class="column">
      <p>
        Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our
        scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes
        civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair
        of star-cross'd lovers take their life; Whose misadventured piteous
        overthrows Do with their death bury their parents' strife. The fearful
        passage of their death-mark'd love, And the continuance of their
        parents' rage, Which, but their children's end, nought could remove, Is
        now the two hours' traffic of our stage; The which if you with patient
        ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

    <h3>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h3>
    <p><em>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and
    bucklers</p></em>
    <h4>SAMPSON</h4>
    Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
    <h4>GREGORY</h4>
    No, for then we should be colliers.
